---

### Feature 2.4: Audit Log Database Persistence ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Status:** CRITICAL GAP - Infrastructure exists but not saving data
**BDD Feature:** `features/phase2/feature-2.4-audit-log-persistence.feature`

**Problem Identified:**
Feature 2.3 (FCRA Audit Logging) infrastructure exists but database persistence is NOT implemented.
- AuditLoggingService collects data but discards it (lines 107-108 commented out)
- No AuditLog entity in Domain layer
- No database table created
- NO FCRA COMPLIANCE - Cannot respond to consumer access requests or regulatory audits

**Capabilities Required:**
- Create `AuditLog` entity with proper EF Core configuration
- Add `DbSet<AuditLog>` to EnrichmentDbContext
- Uncomment database persistence in `AuditLoggingService.cs`
- Create migration: `AddAuditLogTable`
- Index on `BuyerId`, `PhoneHash`, `Timestamp` for fast queries
- Partition table by month for performance (326M+ record dataset expected)

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    buyer_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    phone_hash VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,  -- SHA-256 hash (privacy)
    permissible_purpose VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    ip_address VARCHAR(45),
    response VARCHAR(20),
    status_code INT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_buyer ON audit_logs(buyer_id, timestamp DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_phone ON audit_logs(phone_hash, timestamp DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_timestamp ON audit_logs(timestamp DESC);
```

**FCRA Requirements:**
- ✅ Phone number hashing (already implemented in service)
- ❌ 24-month retention (NOT persisting data)
- ❌ Immutable audit trail (NO database table)
- ❌ Consumer access request support (NO data to query)
- ❌ Quarterly compliance reports (NO data to report)

**Tasks:**
1. Create Domain/Entities/AuditLog.cs entity
2. Create Infrastructure/Persistence/Configurations/AuditLogConfiguration.cs
3. Add DbSet<AuditLog> to EnrichmentDbContext
4. Create migration: `dotnet ef migrations add AddAuditLogTable`
5. Update AuditLoggingService.ProcessBatchAsync to persist to database
6. Test batch processing with 100+ entries
7. Verify 24-month retention with automated cleanup job
8. Deploy to production with migration

**Estimate:** 4-6 hours
**Priority:** CRITICAL - FCRA compliance requirement
**Blocking:** Legal compliance, cannot launch without audit trail

---

## PHASE 4: DEPLOYMENT ✅ COMPLETED
